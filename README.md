This dependency mod adds modern minecraft's [brigadier](https://github.com/Mojang/brigadier)  as  the main text command parser.

This allows for a more powerful and simplified way of doing commands.
It also has the added benefit of better suggestions and feedback on user syntax errors.


**Currently WIP. See which features are not yet implemented on todo.md**
